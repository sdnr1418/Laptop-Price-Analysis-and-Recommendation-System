Laptop Price Analysis and Recommendation System
This project uses a dataset of laptops and their specifications to analyze trends, predict prices, and help consumers optimize their purchasing decisions. It is ideal for data science enthusiasts who want to explore EDA, regression modeling, feature engineering, and consumer recommendation systems.


üìä Project Overview

The notebook contains the following key sections:

Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, standardizes formats (e.g., RAM, storage), and encodes categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uses visualization tools like seaborn and matplotlib to discover patterns in pricing based on brand, CPU, RAM, etc.

Feature Engineering: Extracts useful information such as processor type, storage size, and combines categorical features for better predictions.

Price Prediction Model: Builds regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict laptop prices based on specs.

Value for Money Score: Introduces a metric to evaluate whether a laptop is a good deal compared to others.

Recommendation System: Suggests laptops to users based on their budget and preferences using filtering and score-based ranking.
